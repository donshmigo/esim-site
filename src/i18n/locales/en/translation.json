    "q2": "Is my device compatible with eSIM?",

    "q4": "Can I use my eSIM and physical SIM at the same time?",
    "a4": "Yes! That's one of the benefits of eSIM technology. You can keep your regular SIM active for calls and texts, while using the eSIM for data when traveling.",
    "q5": "What happens when my data runs out?",
