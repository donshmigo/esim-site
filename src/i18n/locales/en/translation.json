    "q1": "What is an eSIM?",
    "a1": "An eSIM is a digital SIM that allows you to activate a cellular plan without having to use a physical SIM card. It's built into most newer smartphones and enables easier switching between carriers.",
    "q2": "Is my device compatible with eSIM?",
    "a2": "Most newer smartphones (iPhone XS and newer, Google Pixel 3 and newer, Samsung Galaxy S20 and newer) support eSIM technology. You can check your phone's specifications or contact us to verify compatibility.",
    "q3": "How do I activate my eSIM?",
    "a3": "After purchase, you'll receive a QR code via email. On your phone, go to Settings > Cellular/Mobile > Add Cellular/Mobile Plan, then scan the QR code. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete activation.",
    "q4": "Can I use my eSIM and physical SIM at the same time?",
    "a4": "Yes! That's one of the benefits of eSIM technology. You can keep your regular SIM active for calls and texts, while using the eSIM for data when traveling.",
    "q5": "What happens when my data runs out?",
    "a5": "When your data allocation is exhausted, you can purchase additional data through your account dashboard or set up auto-renewal to avoid interruptions.",
    "q6": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
    "a6": "Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time from your account dashboard. There are no cancellation fees or long-term contracts.",
